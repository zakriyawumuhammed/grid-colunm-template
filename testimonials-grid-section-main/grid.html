                      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br> 
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                      The next 12  <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                      the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
                student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
                did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
                project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way  <br>that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In  <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
                experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.
