  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined.  I <br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br> 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br> 
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12  <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

  The team was very  <br>supportive and kept me <br> motivated

  ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with  <br>virtually no coding skills. I now work  <br>as a mobile engineer 
  for a big <br> company. This was one of the best <br> investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù

  An overall wonderful <br> and rewarding <br> experience

  ‚Äú Thank you for the wonderful  <br>experience! I now have a job I really <br> enjoy, and make a good living 
  while  <br>doing something I love. ‚Äù

  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp  <br>themselves. Getting guidance from  <br>them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.

  ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present  <br>myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

  Such a life-changing  <br>experience. Highly  <br>recommended!

  ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
  professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
  student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
  did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
  project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way  <br>that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In  <br>fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
  100% recommend! ‚Äù
